PuzzleScript Next is intended to be the next version of PuzzleScript, 100% compatible but with all the latest features needed by more advanced developers.
You can try it out [here](https://david-pfx.github.io/PuzzleScriptNext/src/editor.html).

PuzzleScript Next is based on the latest version of the original fantastic [Puzzlescript by Increpare](https://github.com/increpare/PuzzleScript), the great features added in [Puzzlescript Plus by Auroriax](https://github.com/Auroriax/PuzzleScriptPlus) by many authors, plus a few contributions from [my own PuzzleFAB](https://github.com/david-pfx/PuzzleFAB).

This is the first release. There are no new features yet.
