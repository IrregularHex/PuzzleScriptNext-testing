# PuzzleScript Next

PuzzleScript Next is your next version of PuzzleScript, 100% upwardly compatible and with all the latest features needed by more advanced developers.
[The stable release is here](https://puzzlescriptnext.polyomino.com/) and the [latest version for testing is here](https://david-pfx.github.io/PuzzleScriptNext/src/index.html).

PuzzleScript Next is a combination of the work of many authors:

* the great features added in [Puzzlescript Plus by Auroriax](https://github.com/Auroriax/PuzzleScriptPlus)
* more great features added in [Pattern:Script](https://clementsparrow.github.io/Pattern-Script)
* a few contributions from my own [PuzzleFAB](https://github.com/david-pfx/PuzzleFAB)
* and ongoing development work inspired by its many users (like you).
