# PuzzleScript Next

PuzzleScript Next is your next version of PuzzleScript, 100% upwardly compatible and with all the latest features needed by more advanced developers.
[The stable release is here](https://puzzlescriptnext.polyomino.com/) and the [latest version for testing is here](https://david-pfx.github.io/PuzzleScriptNext/src/index.html).

The [full merged documentation is here](https://david-pfx.github.io/PuzzleScriptNext/src/Documentation).
For the first time ever, all the features contributed by original PuzzleScript, PuzzleScriptPlus and Pattern:Script can be found in this one place.

PuzzleScript Next is a combination of the work of many authors:
* the original fantastic [Puzzlescript by Increpare](https://github.com/increpare/PuzzleScript)
* the great features added in [Puzzlescript Plus by Auroriax](https://github.com/Auroriax/PuzzleScriptPlus)
* more great features added in [Pattern:Script](https://clementsparrow.github.io/Pattern-Script)
* a few contributions from my own [PuzzleFAB](https://github.com/david-pfx/PuzzleFAB)
* and ongoing development work inspired by its many users (like you).

## New Features and Fixes
The latest version is Release v-24e01. 
* Inline expansion of rules referring to the absence of an object by a relative reference now works correctly.
For example: `late [ wall no wall:>:quarterTiles ] -> [ wall wall:>:fill ]`

Recent new features include the following. For detail see the documentation.
* Level branching based on a LINK command, and a test program showing how it can be used.
* A new debugging command `log`, which writes a message to the console.
* The menus now more distinctively identify this is PuzzleScript Next.

Several other bugs have already been fixed.
* No longer crashes on resizing the browser window.
* Setting sound volume has been fixed to be compatible with Pattern:Script.
* Share authorisation now works correctly independntly of where it is hosted.
* Undo across a link now works correctly.
* An object that has a `copy:` referring to an implied TAG object now resolves correctly.
* A TAG object with a sprite that is redefined uses the second sprite instead of appending it.
* MESSAGE or other justified text no longer crashes if it contains consecutive newlines: `\n\n`.
* Some minor issues with menu wording have been corrected.
* Debug visualisation now works correctly from one level to another.
* The pause screen now works on mobile and tablet devices.

Also some new documentation:
* [Tags and Mappings](https://david-pfx.github.io/PuzzleScriptNext/src/Documentation/tags_and_mappings.html).
* [Tips and Tricks](https://david-pfx.github.io/PuzzleScriptNext/src/Documentation/tips_and_tricks.html).
